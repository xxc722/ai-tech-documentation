# Model Optimization

## 1. Overview
This section covers techniques for optimizing machine learning models in production environments.

## 2. Key Techniques

- **Quantization**: Reducing model size by converting weights from 32-bit to 8-bit integers
- **Pruning**: Removing redundant neurons and connections from neural networks
- **LLM Optimization Techniques**: Methods for improving large language model efficiency including:
  - Knowledge distillation
  - Flash attention implementation
  - Dynamic batching strategies

## 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Latency reduction percentage
- Memory usage optimization
- Accuracy retention rate
